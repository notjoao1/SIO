# CWE-434: Unrestricted File Upload

**Severity**: 7.7

**CVSS Vector String**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

### Description

The online shop's file upload functionality in user reviews does not adequately validate uploaded files for their size or type. This vulnerability allows users to upload files, including potentially malicious ones, without proper checks.

A file can be uploaded when creating a user review for a product, intended for images/files related to the purchase. 

Potential risks are:

- **Malware Distribution**: Attackers can upload and distribute malicious files such as viruses, trojans, or ransomware to other users, potentially compromising their systems.
 user tries to upload image larger than 4MB, but can't.
- **Denial of Service**: Large files can be uploaded to overwhelm the server, leading to a denial of service condition.

The vulnerable code is related to the HTML form:

*shop/forms.py*
```py
class ReviewForm(forms.Form):
    review = forms.CharField(label='',widget=forms.Textarea(
        attrs={'class': 'form-control', 'id': 'reviewProduct', 'rows': '4',
               'placeholder': "Your opinion on the product"}
    ))
    rating = forms.IntegerField(widget=forms.HiddenInput(
        attrs={'id': 'hiddenRating'},
    ))
    user_review_image = forms.FileField(label='', required=False, widget=forms.FileInput(attrs={
        'class': 'form-control', 'style': 'width: 20%', 'id': 'imageReviewInput'
    }))

    def clean(self):
        cleaned_data = super().clean() # invoke parent_class
        comment = cleaned_data.get('review')
        rating = cleaned_data.get('rating')
        user_review_image = cleaned_data.get('user_review_image')
        if comment is None:
            raise forms.ValidationError("A comment about the product is required. Please tell us your opinion")
        if rating is None or rating == 0:
            raise forms.ValidationError("Rating is required. Please select a rating.")

        return cleaned_data
```

In particular, the form has a Django `FileField` for uploading files, with no limitation of file type or size.

```py
user_review_image = forms.FileField(label='', required=False, widget=forms.FileInput(attrs={
        'class': 'form-control', 'style': 'width: 20%', 'id': 'imageReviewInput'
    }))
```


### Exploitation

In the add review forms we can opt for uploading a file (supposedly an image) to be attached to the respective review. However as previously mentioned neither the type of file or size are verified. 
An attacker may upload an extremely large file that consumes excessive server resources causing the server to become slow or unresponsive.
Another exploitation may be the uploading of files containing malware (viruses and trojans for example) or scripts that may be acessed/executed and compromise the system.

### Mitigations

- We only accept a set of valid file extensions for image by using Django default ImageField.
- We limited file size to a reasonable amount (4 MB);
```python
class ReviewForm(forms.Form):
    review = forms.CharField(label='',widget=forms.Textarea(
        attrs={'class': 'form-control', 'id': 'reviewProduct', 'rows': '4',
               'placeholder': "Your opinion on the product"}
    ))
    rating = forms.IntegerField(widget=forms.HiddenInput(
        attrs={'id': 'hiddenRating'},
    ))
    user_review_image = forms.ImageField(label='', required=False, widget=forms.FileInput(attrs={
        'class': 'form-control', 'style': 'width: 20%', 'id': 'imageReviewInput'
    }))

    def clean(self):
        cleaned_data = super().clean() # invoke parent_class
        comment = cleaned_data.get('review')
        rating = cleaned_data.get('rating')
        user_review_image = cleaned_data.get('user_review_image')
        if comment is None:
            raise forms.ValidationError("A comment about the product is required. Please tell us your opinion")
        if rating is None or rating == 0:
            raise forms.ValidationError("Rating is required. Please select a rating.")
        if user_review_image and user_review_image.size > 4*1024*1024:
            raise forms.ValidationError("Image is too large (> 4 MB)")

        return cleaned_data
```

### Demonstration

This section will have video footage of *exploiting the vulnerabilities* and *trying to exploit them after a fix is implemented*:

#### Exploiting the Vulnerability

- The user uploads a 45MB video, when the developers intended for images to be uploaded. This could be further exploited by uploading a much larger video. 

[INSECURE_FILE_UPLOAD.webm](https://github.com/detiuaveiro/1st-project-group_04/assets/97046574/61381c67-06c6-419e-93e2-7602915102f2)


#### Trying to exploit after fix is implemented

- The user tries to upload image larger than 4MB, but can't.

https://github.com/detiuaveiro/1st-project-group_04/assets/97046574/d1f87005-8c22-43c4-b93c-64d3ec375e95


- The user tries to upload a malicious script (`malware.js`), but can't since only images are allowed (any filetype that is not an image, is rejected).
