# CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal, CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor


**Severity**: 6.5

**CVSS Vector String**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### Description

An authenticated user can order products, which starts an order request. Upon completion of the order (checkout complete), the user has the ability to download an invoice file associated to that request.

In the following code we allow the download of the file without proper verification regarding who the user is and what file is he trying to download through the file parameter in the request.

```python
@login_required
def download_invoice(request):
    file_name = request.GET.get("file")
    # Invoices are located at /media/invoices/
    invoices_path = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, "invoices")
    path = os.path.join(invoices_path, file_name)
    
    order_id = file_name.split(".")[0]
    try:
        if not os.path.exists(path):
            create_invoice(order_id)
        # serve file for download here
        response = FileResponse(open(path, 'rb'))
        response['Content-Type'] = 'application/octet-stream'
        response['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="{file_name}"'
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception ocurred: ", e)


    messages.error(request, 'Invalid invoice file requested.', 'danger')
    return redirect('shop:home_page')
```

A network analysis shows that clicking the download button triggers an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8000/download?file=<file_name>`.

By manipulating the *file* query parameter, it is possible to exploit this vulnerability to **access files outside of the server's directory** and **access invoices belonging to other users**.

This means that an attacker can potentially extract any file in the server's filesystem and download it to their own machine, and also access invoices that belong to other users without authorization, which violates their privacy. Furthermore, in a real scenario where the checkout and invoices are fully implemented there would be an exposure to critical information like the customer's address and his/her phone number.

### Exploitation

An attacker can directly call the download endpoint with an HTTP GET request including a malicious query parameter for the file name. By using traversal techniques, the attacker can access sensitive files, such as `/etc/passwd` or an invoice beloging to another user. 

#### Broken Authorization:

Simply sending an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8000/download?file=<file_name>` where the `file_name` is an invoice file belonging to another user, an attacker could get information related to another user without authorization.

#### Path traversal:

Path traversal is achieved by appending `../` to the file path until the root directory is reached.

Example: `http://localhost:8000/orders/download?file=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

### Mitigations

To fix this vulnerability, we must guarantee the following conditions:

- The requested invoice file belongs and can only be accessed by the requesting user.
- The path to the file is within the current working directory, where invoice files are located.

For these purposes, we changed the code to be more secure:

```py
@login_required
def download_invoice(request):
    file_name = request.GET.get("file")

    invoices_path = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, "invoices")
    path = os.path.join(invoices_path, file_name)
    # absolute path, consumes all '../', needed to check for common path 
    abs_path = os.path.abspath(path)

    order_id = file_name.split(".")[0]
    # allow download if user who requested download made the order aswell
    # prevent path traversal by checking that requested file in inside the invoices_path directory
    if invoice_belongs_to_user(request.user.id, order_id) and (os.path.commonpath([abs_path, invoices_path]) == invoices_path):
        try:
            if not os.path.exists(path):
                create_invoice(order_id)
            # serve file for download here
            response = FileResponse(open(path, 'rb'))
            response['Content-Type'] = 'application/octet-stream'
            response['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="{file_name}"'
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            print("Exception ocurred: ", e)


    messages.error(request, 'You are not allowed to download that file.', 'danger')
    return redirect('shop:home_page')

# Returns true if order with id=order_id was made by user with id=user_id
def invoice_belongs_to_user(user_id : int, order_id : str):
    try:
        order = get_object_or_404(Order, id=order_id)
        if order.user.id == user_id:
            return True
    except Exception as e:
        return False
    return False
```

This line in particular - `os.path.commonpath([abs_path, invoices_path]) == invoices_path` - guarantees that the path of the file name is the directory where invoices are located. Requesting file `../../something.txt`, takes you outside of that directory, which is not allowed.



### Demonstrations


This section will have video footage of *exploiting the vulnerabilities* and *trying to exploit them after they've been fixed*:


#### Exploiting Vulnerability

- Downloading invoice that belongs to someone else: this attacker has only made a single order with **id 6**. But the attacker then downloads another invoice by changing file parameter in the URL to `1.txt`, which requests the server for invoice `1.txt`. The order with **id 1** belongs to another user.

- Exploiting path traversal weakness to get a file from outside the web server working directory, in this case `/etc/passwd`.

#### Trying to exploit after fix is implemented

- The user tries to extract an invoice related to another user, but can't and gets an error message.
