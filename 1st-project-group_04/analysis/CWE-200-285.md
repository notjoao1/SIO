# CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, CWE-285: Improper Authorization

**Severity**: 7.1

**CVSS Vector String**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

### Description

There are inadequate enforced access controls, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions or access resources they should not have permission for.

The *Edit Profile* feature has inadequately enforced access control. It allows attackers to access and change private information related to other users.

A bad actor could easily extract the full name and email of another user, even having the possibility of changing those values.

The vulnerable endpoint is the following:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/profile/{id}`

*accounts/urls.py*

```py
    path('profile/<int:userid>', views.edit_profile, name='edit_profile'),
```

Whenever that endpoint is accessed, the `edit_profile` function is executed, with `userid` as `{id}` from the URL :

*accounts/views.py*

```py
def edit_profile(request, userid):
    user = get_object_or_404(User, id=userid)
    form = EditProfileForm(request.POST, instance=user)
    if form.is_valid():
        form.save()
        messages.success(request, 'Your profile has been updated', 'success')
        return redirect('accounts:edit_profile')
    else:
        form = EditProfileForm(instance=user)
    context = {'title':'Edit Profile', 'form':form}
    return render(request, 'edit_profile.html', context)
```

It will render the `edit_profile.html` page based on the requested *userid*.

An attacker can change the value of **id** to an id related to another existing user, and access information about them, which he shouldn't be authorized to.

### Exploitation



To exploit the broken access control, an attacker could simply access the *edit profile* option in his profile, and change the URL.

Example:

The attacker has an internal account id of 2, which means the url to be accessed to edit his profile is:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/profile/2
```

By simply changing the value of *2* to *1*, he could access the account information of user with `id = 1`:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/profile/1
```

### Mitigations

We changed the url mapping so that now a user can only access his own profile through the profile/edit URL. Then we utilize the django request object attribute user to get the current user and display the correct information without ever needing to use the user's id.

urls.py
```python
path('profile/edit', views.edit_profile, name='edit_profile'),
```
base.hmtl
```html
<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="{% url 'accounts:edit_profile' %}">Edit Profile</a></li>
```

views.py
```py
def edit_profile(request):
    form = EditProfileForm(request.POST, instance=request.user)
    if form.is_valid():
        form.save()
        messages.success(request, 'Your profile has been updated', 'success')
        return redirect('accounts:edit_profile')
    else:
        form = EditProfileForm(instance=request.user)
    context = {'title':'Edit Profile', 'form':form}
    return render(request, 'edit_profile.html', context)
```

### Demonstration

This section will have video footage of *exploiting the vulnerabilities* and *trying to exploit them after they've been fixed*:

#### Exploiting Vulnerability

- Accessing a user profile of another user:

#### Trying to exploit after fix is implemented

- The user accesses the **Edit Profile** page, and he can no longer change the URL to access another users' profile.
