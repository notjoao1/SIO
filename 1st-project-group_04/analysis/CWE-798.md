# CWE - 798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials

**Severity**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N

**CVSS Vector String**: 9.3

### Description

During development of the website, the developers use hard-coded credentials to access the website, and test features in different roles, such as manager and regular user.

When deploying to production, it's crucial to remember to remove these **hard-coded credentials**, since bad actors could access the website using them.

Every time the server starts running, a default administration account (shop manager) is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product (managerpass1234) and associated with that account (manager@example.com).

- Views.py
```python
def create_manager():
    """
    to execute once on startup:
    this function will call in online_shop/urls.py
    """
    if not User.objects.filter(email="manager@example.com").first():
        user = User.objects.create_user(
            "manager@example.com", 'shop manager' ,'managerpass1234'
        )
        # give this user manager role
        user.is_manager = True
        user.save()
```
- wsgi.py
```python
import os
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
from accounts.views import create_manager
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'online_shop.settings')
# create user with 'manager' role
create_manager()
application = get_wsgi_application()
```


### Exploitation

An attacker could try using a brute-force attack with common testing credentials, such as:

    email: test@test.com 
    password: test

    email: manager@example.com
    password: managerpass1234
    ...

And potentially get access to a testing account with manager privileges.

### Mitigations

To avoid such cases, developers should develop a script that erases all the created hard-coded credentials from a list of hard coded credentials decided prior to development. 

Another strategy would be to use separate databases for *production* and *development*.

Pairing these two practices, will reduce the probability of leaving *hard-coded credentials* as a vulnerability.

In our case, all it took was deleting the create_manager function that creates the manager upon every server startup and deleting the manager user from the database using the manage.py shell.

- EraseManager.py - python script that erases the hard-coded manager;
```python
from accounts.models import User
user = User.objects.all().filter(email="manager@example.com")
if user:
    user[0].delete()
```

- Command Line Execution;
```bash
$ cat EraseManager.py | python3 manage.py shell
# verifying deletion
